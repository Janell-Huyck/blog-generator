1 - when creating a post with the button using the same "title" as has already been created, no error message shows, no error handling, we get a 500 error on the react app, and although the post is created, it is not saved.

2 - when you click submit on the react app, there is no indication that the button has been pressed.  We need a spinning icon or something to indicate that the app is running in the background

3 - double submit when clicking button - it's causing the 500 error above.

4 - react app doesn't re-render when I create a new post.  do we need to subscribe to something, or should i refresh after submitting?  How to handle...

5 - blog isn't showing paragraph breaks that ChatGPT is supplying

6 - we need to limit clicking the button to people who have signed in.

7 - ChatGPT blog post is cutting off in the middle of sentences
